 This tool can be used to visualize tropical submodules of degree 2 on an interval. Points with white border correspond to generating functions of the tropical module. These points are color coded and their corresponding rational function is visualized on the left. The point with red border represents a divisor of degree 2, which is visualized as a pair of chips on an interval on the top. When the divisor lies outside of the tropical module, its projection into the tropical module is depicted using a dashed line.

## How to use:
- Drag points around with left click
- Right click on empty space in triangle to add a generator the the linear series
- Right click on a generator to remove it
