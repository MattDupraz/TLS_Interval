This tool visualizes tropical submodules of the complete linear system of degree 2 on an interval. It shows the divisor as
1. A pair of points on an interval
2. A point in the complete linear system (which is a simplex)
3. The corresponding piece-wise linear function

The user can select a finite set of points in the complete linear system and visualize the tropical submodule generated by these points,
each generator also appears color-coded as a piece-wise linear function, and is projected onto the chosen divisor.

## How to use:
- Drag points around with left click
- Right click on empty space in triangle to add a generator the the linear series
- Right click on a generator to remove it
